# simpleCalendar

Client side calendar that performs CRUD operations for scheduling appointments. This was a challenge to build a simple app using plain JavaScript with no frameworks.

The next step would be making the days of the month cells dynamic according to the month. That was not part of the exercise though. For now you have to adjust the days manually in index.html.

Open on Firefox.
